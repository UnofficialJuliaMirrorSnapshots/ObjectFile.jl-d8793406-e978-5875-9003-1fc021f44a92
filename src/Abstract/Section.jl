    Sections

An abstraction over the concept of a collection of `Section` types within an
object file.  One can think of the `Sections` object containing the table of
section headers within the object file, whereas the `Section`/`SectionRef`
objects contain the actual section data itself.  The list of available API
operations is given below, with methods that subclasses must implement marked
in emphasis:

### Creation
  - *Sections()*

### Iteration
  - getindex()
  - *lastindex()*
  - length()
  - iterate()
  - keys()
  - eltype()

### Search
  - findall()
  - findfirst()

### Misc.

    Section

An abstraction over the concept of a `Section` within an object file.  Because
many operations upon sections require global operations (access to the string
table, knowledge of position within the file, etc...) some operations are
defined only upon the `SectionRef` datatype.  As a user, the `SectionRef` type
should be the primary method of interacting with sections, as a developer
adding new object file formats, some methods must support `Section`s, others
must support only `SectionRef`s.  Note that any method that works on a
`Section` must also work with a `SectionRef`, see the `@derefmethod` macro for
a convenient helper macro to generate `SectionRef` -> `Section` wrapper
methods. The list of available API operations is given below, with methods that
subclasses must implement marked in emphasis:

### Creation:
  - *read()*

### Utility:
  - deref()

### IO-like operations:

  - *section_size()*

    section_name(section::Section)

Return the name of the given section as a string.  In order to return a true
name, it is necessary to perform a lookup within the object's string table,
which cannot be done using just a `Section` object; use a `SectionRef` object
instead if you need that.  For sanity sake, this method will return a string,
but the contents of the string may be something like the offset within the
string table pointing to this `Section`'s name, e.g. "@strtab.123"
