This package provides basic functionality to read and analyze binary object files. It was written with ELF/MachO/COFF in mind, but should be easily adaptable to other object files as well.  While not originally intended as a package to enable the construction of a compiler/linker, the package authors welcome any and all efforts to extend the capabilities of this package toward synthesis of object files as well as the analysis of them.
